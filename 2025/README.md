This started as an attempt to use Advent of Code 2025 as prompt to
learn Forth. I got a slow but steady start on that effort but have
decided to switch over to (of all things) QB64PE, a 64 bit version
of QBasic. Life has dealt me some really bad cards over the past
month and I don't have the reserves to deal with a new and very 
different language. Days 1, 2, and part of 3 have been done in
Forth and a lot of helper code has accumulated.

I've redone days 1 and 2 and am starting 3 over again. Hopefully
I'll be able to finish this year's AoC in QB64PE and then return to
try to do it in Forth later.
